PROJECT PLANNING
----------------
    1. Summarize the app ("elevator pitch") and identify CRUD entities
    2. Create user stories
    3. Extract a feature list from the user stories
    4. Diagram the DB design
    5. Create wireframes and possibly mockups for all application views
    6. Transfer planning documents to GitHub repo
    7. Transfer feature list to Kanban Board

    ----------------------------
    PROJECT SUMMARY AND ENTITIES
    ----------------------------
        Summary: the elevator pitch for the app idea in a brief synopsis
        Entities: the main records the app will CRUD

    ------------
    USER STORIES
    ------------
        An explanation of an action a certain type of user can take in the application from their perspective.

    ------------
    FEATURE LIST
    ------------
        - A development task to complete a user story. Multiple tasks and subtasks may fall under the same story
        - Need to have features vs. Nice to have features
        - Be intentional and aware of the timeline

        Ex: Story -> As a visiter, I navigate to the app domain and see the landing page containing the app pitch and a call to sign up.
            - feat: View landing page
            - feat: Link landing page to register page

        * The more specific you can be, the better it is

     ---------------
     DATABASE DESIGN
     ---------------
        - A database design should be created that specifically accomplishes the user stories

     PROJECT MANAGEMENT
     ------------------
        - Buzzwords
            - “Agile” - project management methodology of continuous cycles (ideals outlined in Agile Manifesto)
            - “Waterfall” - project development in separate distinct phases
            - “Scrum” - a specific flavor of Agile management using sprints and daily standups (can use Kanban boards)
            - “Sprint” - typically a 2 week development lifecycle in Scrum
            - “Kanban” - another flavor of Agile
            - “Standup” - a quick daily meeting where each member gives update on:
                    - what they’ve done
                    - what they will do
                    - identify any blockers (support needs)
