What are JSPs and why do we use them?
    -JSP stands for Java Server Pages. JSP allows us to create HTML pages with
        dynamic content by letting us mix Java code into our HTML. Using JSPs
        is much easier than writing HTML inside of strings inside of servlets.

    -JSP file is executed on the server, and what the user sees in their
        browser is the end result of that process. That is, the end result is
        just HTML; web browsers don't ever see the JSP as we see it.



What are JSP tags?
    - tag-like elements that start with <% and end with %>. These are
        used to define the dynamic parts of the page. When the JSP file is
        processed, everything inside of the <% %> tags are evaluated,
        and a purely HTML response is produced.



  Directive tag?
    EXAMPLE: <%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" language="java" %>

    -Directive: set values for the entire file

    -We can use it similar to the meta tag

    -Directives allow us to set conditions that apply to the
        entire JSP file. The example above is a page directive,
        and is used to specify the content type of this page. Most
        JSP files you create will include this directive.



  Declaration tag?
    EXAMPLE: <%! int i = 0; %>
             <%! int a, b, c; %>
             <%! Circle a = new Circle(2.0); %>

    -Used to declare variables

    -A declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in
        Java code later in the JSP file. You must declare the variable or method
        before you use it in the JSP file.



  Expression tag?
    EXAMPLE: <html>
                <head><title>A Comment Test</title></head>

                <body>
                   <p>Today's date: <%= (new java.util.Date()).toLocaleString()%></p>
                </body>
             </html>

    -Used to evaluate variables

    -A JSP expression element contains a scripting language expression that is
        evaluated, converted to a String, and inserted where the expression
        appears in the JSP file.

    -Because the value of an expression is converted to a String, you can use an
        expression within a line of text, whether or not it is tagged with HTML,
        in a JSP file.





  Scriptlet tag? Why are they no longer commonly used?
    B/c it's terrible don't use them



  JSP comment tag vs. HTML comment tag?
    -JSP tags are read server side, so they are never seen by the browser



What are partials and why are they awesome?
    EXAMPLE:

        -A partial is a page with a piece of HTML or other code that can be included into
            other pages. Best examples are header and footer files that are being included
            into all pages of the website. You may also have complicated logic that
            you would like to separate or some repetitive code.



How can I use them in JSPs?
    -Use as a template for your documents
